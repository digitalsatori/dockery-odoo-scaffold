#   * write all lower case
#   * use the imperative mood in the subject line
#   * do not end the subject line with a period
#   * separate subject from body with a blank line
#   * use the body to explain what and why (intent) vs. how
#   * can use multiple lines with "-" or "*" for bullet points in body
