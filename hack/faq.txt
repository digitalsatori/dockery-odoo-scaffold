Q: How to add a dependency once everything is already build:

A: Using https://github.com/OCA/web.git as an example, there are two options:

1) start again from "make init"

2) a) `git submodule add https://github.com/OCA/web.git vendor/OCA/web`
   b) Edit Dockerfile by adding after the line
   	  "## NOTE: later *modules* override their previous namesake"
   	  a new line with:
      `COPY --chown=odoo:odoo vendor/OCA/web/* /opt/odoo/addons/011/`
   c) Edit docker-compose.override.yaml by placing after te line
      "# Put additional volumes here":
      `- ./vendor/OCA/web:/opt/odoo/addons/011:ro`
      Remove "{{ VOLUMES }}"" placeholder, if it should be still there.
   d) And finally do again: `docker-compose up odoo`
   e) Optionally, you also can rebuild the images, right now: `make build`



Q: I get a database connection error (or something similar) when
   refreshing / loading the page, what am I doing wrong?

A: Usal suspects:

1) Have you applied patches of respective version in your vendor/odoo/cc workdir?
   `git submodule update && make patch` - make sure submodule supdate cleanly.
   Alternatively: `cd vendor/odoo/cc git stash` and apply the corresponding
   existing stash, if already created by `make patch`.
2) Is there a new postgres version running (postgres service won't even start)?
   Just delete the postgres docker volume see `docker volume ls`
3) After a version branch change: Have you run `git submodule update`?
   (run `git subdmodule foreach git checkout -- .` to cleanup all submodules)
4) After a version branch change: Does you current session imply direct access
   to an incopatible (version!) data base? (clear cookies + cache)
